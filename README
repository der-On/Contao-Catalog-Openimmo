This module makes it possible to import OpenImmo-Data into an existing catalog.

The files need to be placed within the folder system/modules/catalog_openimmo/

!Deprecated: 
This module is deprecated in favour of https://github.com/der-On/Contao-MetaModels-OpenImmo
If you are still using the catalog module think about switching to the actively maintained metamodels.
